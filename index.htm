        <p class = "p">For millions of people worldwide, drinking coffee is a daily ritual rather than merely a beverage. Coffee is made from roasted beans of the Coffea plant, and depending on how it's made and where it comes from, it can have a varied flavor profile that ranges from strong and bitter to sweet and fruity. Coffee has a special way of giving you both comfort and energy, whether you're sipping a basic black coffee or an intricate macchiato. Coffee shops are becoming common places for people to meet, relax, and work. It is a mainstay in both social gatherings and morning routines due to its fragrant appeal and caffeine boost.</p>
